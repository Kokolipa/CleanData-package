Insert clickable quick links here 


## What is it?

Cleandata is an easy to use Python library for data cleansing operations with the main focus on reducing the steps required on each sub-process included in the data pre-processing step with scientific approach:
1. Reducing memory consumption for dataset with decreased byte sizes.
2. Considering MAR, MCAR, and MNAR cases to treat case-specific NA values.
3. Treating and dropping duplicated values.
4. Using scientific methods to treat anomalies.
5. Treating text typos.
6. Using AI state-of-the-art models (**TAPAS**) for Table Question Answering purposes to enhance the workflow and reduce the overall time consumption for data exploration.
